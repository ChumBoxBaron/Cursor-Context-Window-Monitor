Context Window Management Best Practices
=====================================

1. Session Management Best Practices
----------------------------------
- Start a new session when:
  * You're beginning work on a new feature or component
  * Your current session is longer than 2-3 hours
  * You notice the AI's responses becoming less accurate or relevant
  * You're approaching 80% of the context window (as our monitor will now warn you)
  * You're switching between different parts of your project

2. Code Organization Tips
------------------------
- Keep your code modular and well-organized
- Split large files into smaller, focused modules
- Use clear file and directory structures
- Document important decisions and complex logic
- Consider using a project documentation tool

3. Chat Management Tips
----------------------
- Keep conversations focused on specific tasks
- Start new chats for different features or components
- Save important code snippets and decisions in separate files
- Use comments to document key decisions
- Consider using a note-taking app for important decisions

4. Project Structure Recommendations
----------------------------------
- Create a 'docs' directory for important decisions and context
- Use a 'README.md' for project overview and setup instructions
- Keep a 'CHANGELOG.md' for tracking major changes
- Consider using a project management tool for tracking tasks and decisions

5. When to Start New Sessions
----------------------------
- After completing a major feature
- When switching between different parts of your project
- When you notice the AI's responses becoming less accurate
- When you're approaching the context window limit
- After 2-3 hours of continuous work
- When starting work on a new component

Additional Tips
--------------
- Use the Context Window Monitor to track your usage
- Pay attention to the monitor's recommendations
- Consider using version control (Git) for tracking changes
- Implement automated testing to catch potential issues
- Keep your development environment clean and organized
- Regular code reviews can help identify areas that need refactoring
- Document complex algorithms and business logic thoroughly
- Consider using code documentation tools
- Keep your dependencies up to date
- Regular backups of important code and documentation

Remember: The key to maintaining high-quality AI assistance is to manage your context window effectively and start new sessions when appropriate. The Context Window Monitor will help you make these decisions by providing real-time feedback about your usage.
